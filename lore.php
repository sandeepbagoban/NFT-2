                    <p>We are in January 1877 when the Satsuma rebellion,
                    Seisan Sensō broke out opposing the last samurai and the
                    new imperial government following the ban on the wearing of the sword
                    for samurai.</p>

                    <p>At the time, Saigo Takamori, head of the Satsuma domain had
                    decided to train a new generation of samurai warriors with traditional
                    techniques. For him, this ban was a disrespectful and destructive measure
                    for the samurai and their bushido, the samurai code of honor composed of 7
                    great principles: Gi, uprightness and sense of duty; Yu, heroic courage; Jin,
                    benevolence and compassion; Rei, politeness and respect; Makoto, sincerity
                    and truth; Meiyo, honor; Chu, duty and loyalty.</p>

                    <p>Saigo therefore considered it a provocation and retaliated by putting
                    his samurai battalion in combat order.</p>

                    <p>In February, he even undertook to besiege the imperial garrison of the fortified
                    castle of Kumamoto. This strategic error was to be his undoing, as the government
                    took advantage of this « stumbling block » to send some 300,000 conscript soldiers
                    to the island.</p>

                    <p>After six weeks of fierce fighting, Saigo and his battalion of twenty
                    thousand men succumbed. Around the traditional chief, only a few hundred valiant
                    warriors remained, veterans of already ruthless fights, who withdrew with Saigo
                    on the hill of Shiroyama facing the imperial army of 30 000 men of Yamagata Aritomo.</p>

                    <p>On September 1, 1877, the ultimate battle took place between the ancestral
                    practices of the samurai and modern combat techniques, ten to one.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, in spite of an unequalled determination where the fate
                    of all the samurais depended on only one man, Saigo was not able
                    to fight anymore and to die with honor, he decided with the help
                    of his faithful lieutenant Shinsuke Beppu to practice seppuku / harakiri,
                    suicide by disembowelment by means of a wakizashi (short sword).</p>

                    <p>After this tragedy, an event will upset the chronology we know and 
                    create an alternative reality. This event is the birth of a hidden daughter of Saigo Takamori.</p>

                    <p>Following this defeat, this secret was well kept and the girl took the fa
                    mily name Takahashi to avoid any suspicion.</p>

                    <p>We are now, 2000 years later, and we are going to follow the destiny of a certain Isamu
                    Takahashi, in a world that has totally gone to hell, where the time of cybernetics is at
                    its peak.</p>

                    <p>However, if there is something that has not changed it is the imperial army.</p>

                    <p>Indeed, in this alternate reality, following the crushing victory of the imperial army,
                    Yamagata Aritomo has become very famous and powerful. 2000 years later,
                    his family rules the country and especially the world of the rich, in front of the
                    unhealthy and uncontrollable steampunk districts, where Isamu lived.</p>
